## Live demo

[Demo on Netlify](https://voluble-blancmange-7fa206.netlify.app).

**Note**. The application has a login section. Please use "admin/admin" (username/password) to login.

## Extra features

- Testimonials on the home page.
- Search with autocompletion.
- Admin pages: login, view and delete quotes.

## Solving approach
 
I wrote myself almost all of the application code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/React), without using any ready templates or solutions. Except the slider on the home page. The slider is one of React libraries.

Although, I could finish the assignment quicker if I had used ready templates. But I wanted to use this opportunity to improve my frontend coding skills. 

## Used tools

- React 18.2.0.
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) - as a local test DB.
- Visual Studio Code.

## Setting up the development environment

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Install React (if not installed yet).
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm start`.
